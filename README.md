# Project1
WHAT IS THIS PROJECT:
	This is a fun project of calculating your(anyone) age in your phone or tablet. It asks for your Date of 
	Birth(written as DOB inside app) and the app will display your Age instantly.
	I've used Kotlin language to build this app. Enough talking, lets go to format of input.
FORMAT OF INPUT:
	It is clearly written in the hints that in which format you have to give the DOB; however the format is as follows
	format: DD MM YYYY 
  Note: Current date is written by default at the 'Age At The Date of' tab.Feel free to change it if you want to give your preferred date.
   -->  If your Date of Birth is 19 Jan 2000 then you have to type 19 1 2000 or 19 01 2000
	if you wrote 19/1/2000 it will show 'can not display age.'
   -->  Note: It should not contain any special characters like '/' or '\' or '-'.There should be one space between date,
	month and year of birth each.
 ***VERY IMPORTANT*** 
	Because it is a beginner project I've not resistered this app in the Google Play store, hence Google Play will stop
	you from installing third party app obviously.It is RECOMMENDED to install the app after you turn off the internet.


		NOT A VERY GREAT APP, BUT I ENJOYED A LOT LEARNING SOME CONCEPTS. HAVE FUN.
